\chapter{Prerequisites}
\Epigraph{``Dammit, I forgot my briefcase.``}{\textit{annoyed dog at the airport}}
First of all, before any theory, equation or anything,
you must know this.
I'm assuming you understand English, have a computer and access to the
internet.

You must like AE, like most things in life, if you
don't truly like it, it doesn't last, or it doesn't end well.

Everything here doesn't appear from day to night, it's an everyday
effort (and a endless pursue), so take your time and work on this
with calm and in your own velocity.

At last, some times we can forget some elementary things, so here
some links so you can catch-up on this.

\section{Culture}

If you don't know, like most human-made things, humanity
has create histories and a sub-culture about aerospace that envelopes
technology, war, beauty, and everything that makes a good novel.

Get on this is good for you, it will make a better professional,
a better academic, and a better person. But I cannot guide
you in this path, this is on you.

\section{Search Engines}
Search Engines are the most powerful tool that
internet can provide us. Get to know how to use them, how to search
and find what you want.


\section{Bibliography}
Books historically are a difficult thing to find,
but things got a little different now-days. Here some links
to find books, papers and articles.

    \item{\href{https://gen.lib.rus.ce/}{Library Genesis} -- Every book you can imagine}
    \item{\href{https://sci-hub.tw/}{Sci-Hub} -- Any published paper}
\end{description}{}

\section{Social Skills}

Even that we like flying machines, we're still humans,
and most important this is engineering, this is about and for people.
You must learn how to communicate properly (with your colleagues,
professors, and anyone), being clear, concise and respectful in
the most occasions.

One of the most important skills on a engineer is to be able to
work with other professionals from different areas, the world
is plural, we must have a global view and a shallow wide knowledge
about the world we current live in.
